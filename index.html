        <h2>Hi there, Thanks for checking out my portfolio!</h2>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate from MSU with a bachelor's degree in Games and Interactive Media. I have been programming since I was 12 and have always had a passion for games and how they are made. In my senior year of high school I took a game design class and ever since then, I've known it's what I want to do. While studying at Michigan State, I had the opportunity to work on multiple games including Sneakeasy by Spartasoft Studios and Bears Hug which was made for a game jam. I have experience in scripting, level design, and system design. I also have quite a bit of experience designing and building websites.

            This game was my first experience working with a large team on a game. My role on the team was scripting enemy AI and pathfinding as well as helping program detection systems.
