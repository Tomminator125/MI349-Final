    <h2>Hi there, Thanks for checking out my portfolio!</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate from MSU with a bachelor's degree in Games and Interactive Media. I have been programming
      since I was 12 and have always had a passion for games and how they are made. In my senior year of high school, I
      took a game design class, and ever since then, I've known it's what I want to do. While studying at Michigan State,
      I had the opportunity to work on multiple games, including Sneakeasy by Spartasoft Studios and Bears Hug, which was
      made for a game jam. I have experience in scripting, level design, and system design. I also have quite a bit of
      experience designing and building websites.

        This game was my first experience working with a large team on a game. My role on the team was scripting enemy
        AI and pathfinding as well as helping program detection systems.

        This game was developed during a game jam hosted by MSU. My role in making this game was all over the place from
        brainstorming and design to programming enemy AI. The game was well received and won best overall during
        judging.

        This was another Game jam game that I worked on for the 2023 GMTK Game Jam. For this project, I didn't have as
        much time to devote to the game jam as I would have liked, so it didn't turn out quite as well as some of my
        other work. For this game, I helped program AI and UI as well as tower placement.
